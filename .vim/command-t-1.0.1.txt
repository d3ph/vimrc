The Command-T plug-in provides an extremely fast, intuitive mechanism for opening files with a minimal number of keystrokes. It's named "Command-T" because it is inspired by the "Go to File" window bound to Command-T in TextMate. 

Files are selected by typing characters that appear in their paths, and are ordered by an algorithm which knows that characters that appear in certain locations (for example, immediately after a path separator) should be given more weight.

install details
To install open the vimball archive in Vim: 

  vim command-t.vba 

Then source it: 

  :so % 

The C extension must also be then compiled; for instance, if Vimball installs your plugin files in ~/.vim, then you would do this: 

  cd ~/.vim/ruby/command-t 
  ruby extconf.rb 
  make 

Note that Command-T requires a version of VIM with Ruby support enabled, and it must be compiled using the same version of Ruby that Vim itself links against. For more details see the documentation:
